Changelog
=========

3.0.3 (unreleased)
------------------

* Fix regression: Any kind of iterable can be used with the ContentAwareGenerator

3.0.2
-----

* Allow installation with Symfony 7.

3.0.1
-----

* Bugfix: Fix handling non-array return from route provider (#279)

3.0.0
-----

* [BC Break] Removed deprecated VersatileRouterInterface::supports, as only string route names are
  allowed since Symfony 6.
* [BC Break] As with Symfony itself, the route name now must be a `string`. As noted in
  the changes for CMF Routing 2.3, to generate a route from an object is to use
  `RouteObjectInterface::OBJECT_BASED_ROUTE_NAME` (`cmf_routing_object`) as
  route name and pass the route object in the parameters with key
  `RouteObjectInterface::ROUTE_OBJECT` (`_route_object`).
* [BC Break] Added static type declarations to interfaces and classes.
* Revoked the deprecation on Router::match because Symfony keeps offering the match without request
  object.
* Support Symfony 6, dropped support for older Symfony versions.

2.3.4
-----

* Allow installation with psr/log 2 and 3

2.3.3
-----

* Allow installation with PHP 8.
  (Note that many dependencies do not yet support PHP 8, this release is mainly useful to test PHP 8 support.)

2.3.2
-----

* ProviderBasedGenerator no longer passes the route object in the parameters
  to the Symfony generator, to avoid bogus query strings e.g. from doctrine
  proxy objects.

2.3.1
-----

* ProviderBasedGenerator now also supports the `RouteObjectInterface::OBJECT_BASED_ROUTE_NAME`
  and `RouteObjectInterface::ROUTE_OBJECT`.

2.3.0
-----

* Dropped support for PHP 7.1 and Symfony 3.4 and 4.3.
* Added support for Symfony 5.
* Deprecated passing a route object (or anything else that is not a string) as
  the `$name` parameter in the `generate` method of the ChainRouter and the
  DynamicRouter. Symfony 5 enforces the `$name` parameter to be a string with
  static type declaration.
  The future proof way to generate a route from an object is to use the route
  name `RouteObjectInterface::OBJECT_BASED_ROUTE_NAME` (`cmf_routing_object`)
  and pass the route object in the parameters with key
  `RouteObjectInterface::ROUTE_OBJECT` (`_route_object`).
* The VersatileGeneratorInterface::supports method is deprecated as it was used
  to avoid errors with routers not supporting objects in `$name`.

2.2.0
-----

* Avoid Symfony 4.3 event dispatcher deprecation warnings.

2.1.1
-----

* Fix warning about `get_class` on `null` in PHP > 7.2

2.1.0
-----

* ChainRouter now returns a new RequestContext if none has been set, to be closer in behaviour to the Symfony router.
* Dropped hhvm support

2.0.3
-----

Fixed edge case in error reporting in ChainRouter.

-----

1.4.0-RC1
---------

 * **2016-01-09**: When ChainRouter::match is used with a RequestMatcher, the
   Request is now properly rebuilt from the RequestContext if that was set on
   the ChainRouter, and http://localhost is used otherwise to avoid issues with
   paths starting with a double forward slash.
 * **2014-09-29**: ChainRouter does not require a RouterInterface, as a
   RequestMatcher and UrlGenerator is fine too. Fixed chain router interface to
   not force a RouterInterface.
