# Symfony CMF Routing Component [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/symfony-cmf/Routing.png)](http://travis-ci.org/symfony-cmf/Routing)

This library extends the Symfony2 Routing component. Even though it has Symfony
in its name, it does not need the full Symfony2 framework and can be used in
standalone projects.
