The Symfony CMF Routing component extends the Symfony2 core routing component.
It provides:

 * A ChainRouter to run several routers in parallel
 * A DynamicRouter that can load routes from any database and can generate
   additional information in the route match.

Even though it has Symfony in its name, the Routing component does not need the
full Symfony2 Framework and can be used in standalone projects.

For Symfon2 projects, an optional
[RoutingBundle](https://github.com/symfony-cmf/RoutingBundle)
is also available.

This library is provided by the [Symfony Content Management Framework (CMF) project](http://cmf.symfony.com/)
and licensed under the [MIT License](LICENSE).
